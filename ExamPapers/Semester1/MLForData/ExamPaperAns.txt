Q1
A)
Predictive analytics is the practice of extracting information from existing data sets in order to 
determine patterns and predict future outcomes and trends.

B)
The difference between supervised algorithms and unsupervised learning algorithms is supervised methods usualy have
a training set to determine the behaviour of its model regarding supervisoed where as unsupervised just has a few basic 
rules and learns the result of the data using such rules by itself. 

C)
Cross-validation is a statistical technique for testing the performance of a Machine Learning model.

Holdout cross validation is the simplest and most common. The data is split into two parts so they have mutually exclusive start and end points.
One part is used for training the model while the other part is used for testing the model.

K-Fold Cross Validation will split the dataset into K equally sized parts, which is used to train the model K times. For
each training run, a single partition from the K parts is randomly designated as the test set and the rest is used for training.

Leave One Out Cross Valiadation splits the data into k amount of folds. It then do iteratives training on k-1 on the model before using 
the k step as the test. It does this in different increment steps for the different folds in increments in the training and testing model.

D)
The curse of dimensionality occurs when too many features are used to train the model in such that when used to analyise other set, it either 
overfits or underfits. This can be dealt with through using key features that actually determine the model mainly combined with using decision
tree models. 

E)

Inductive bias, in relative to the KNN algorithm, invovles looking at the plot and making assumptions, based off our visual guide, the nearest 
neighbour in retrospect to each node before running tests on them.
