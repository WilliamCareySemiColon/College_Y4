What is inductive bias?
Inductive bias is the set of assumptions the learner makes regarding the input provided 
to assume certain outcomes will happen without running any tests on them in a supervised
machine learning environment

Why do we use pruning?
We use pruning to remove certain data, from various dataset sources, that causes the decision tree within the building of a model
inside the machine learning environment, to overfit on the current data used. This allows the model to be versatile when making
decsions from new incoming data and reduces the freqieuncy of the need to retrain the model.

What is a validation set?
A validation set is a set of data used to train artificial intelligence (AI) with the goal of finding and optimizing 
the best model to solve a given problem. Validation sets are also known as dev sets. These tasks are normally completed 
under supevised learning. 

for a dataset, create a confusion matrix
