A bitmap index is a database index that uses bitmaps or bit array.

A bitmap index functionality is to store a bitmap for each index key, which is used to store to store 
pointers to multiple rows. 

The advantage of such system is we can use the functionality to read a collection of data from a schema and
understand the meaning behind the data combined with the amount of memory used to store it combined with 
time processed to collect the requested data.

The disadvantage is time management when the cardinality of the data is medium to high. The accuracy 
can also be a problem with tables that are frequently updated. Best practises is a combination of using 
bitmap indexes for read-only table with low cardinality. 

How big (in Mbytes) is a Bitmap index for a field “Month” (12 values) of a table of 5 million records?  

1 Byte = 8 bits

12 values = 12 bits = 1.5 bytes

1.5 * 5000000 (5 million) = 7500000 (7.5 million) = 7.5Mbytes
