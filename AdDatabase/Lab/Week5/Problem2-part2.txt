The main difference between the two is as the result of the none balancing rule, the tree skews to
the right side. 

The main consquence is the searching pattern, for the bigger numbers, would take longer time with more 
memory management as you go deeper into the levels. The breath-first search algorithm is also not ideal 
with this model design as oppose to the rule of the balancing tree model.
