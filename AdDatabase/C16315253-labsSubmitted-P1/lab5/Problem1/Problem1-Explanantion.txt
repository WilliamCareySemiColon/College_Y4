The Account is the main part of the schema due to the connection to 
each part of the application. So it would make sense to set this part to 
the fact of the application. Another key decision would be the combination
of this to be the most descriptive of the model we are trying to implement
and the fact most banks use accounts to indentify their users as business
requirements. 

All the other parts are additional dimensions to the fact as they provide 
a way to deploy a more comprehensive study of the schema. However, they have
a dependency of the fact to actual provide description suitable for analysis.
Otherwise they only provide vague or simply solutions.

The account also contained the highest granularity (GRAIN) level, which 
is another reason to set it as the fact of the schema.
