Microsoft IDE from the development
	 the middleware is ASP .NET framework 
	 is a web application, any device with internet access can access 
	Research other APIs, such as RESTful

Feature driven development software methodology will be designed using client - server Architecture design pattern.

Outline the main business requirements using various reviewed iterations of prototypes. 
research the various techniques and technologies to handle the different requests for web application. 

document my works on a weekly basis combined with tests 
	configuration of the application & the design pattern 

To obtain layout and requirements for the app, speak to people whom are in the health/nutrient field 

Testing involves 
	manual Testing from professionals and ordinary users 
	Selenium (Front-end testing), Nuit (Business Logic Testing) & DbFit (Database Testing)

Use the git server control to assist me in managing the application.

Once each part is completed, I will use a combination of the Selenium (Front-end testing) Framework, 
Nuit (Business Logic Testing) and DbFit (Database Testing) to run the tests on the system features. 
I will also get peers to manually test the system to get feedback,
 
The evaluation phase would incorporate the feedback of the peers whom have tested the system, 
using the 10 heuristics and comparing with similar technologies to ensure it matches the minimum operation standards
