channels other than HTTP (and HTTPS) requests, and thus not

Values may not include semicolons, commas, or whitespace.
• Browsers do not send the cookie attributes back to the server, just
name and value.
• The attributes are used by the browser to determine when to
delete a cookie, accept or block a cookie, etc.
• Beware of the EU Cookie Laws and GDPR!
