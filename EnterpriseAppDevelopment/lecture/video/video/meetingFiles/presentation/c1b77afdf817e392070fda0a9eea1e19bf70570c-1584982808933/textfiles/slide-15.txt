• The HTTP protocol is stateless
– originally only static pages were served upon request
• With the development of personalization, in order to maintain
information on the server about state (authentication, number of
visits, preferences…), cookies were created
• They are a mechanism for servers to both store and retrieve
information on the client-side, until they expire
• A server can send cookies to the client
– If the browser accepts it, it is stored as plain text
– Then, in subsequent visits, the browser sends the same cookie to the server.
• A cookie can also be created by client-side JavaScript; if so, it can
be read/written to by the client, as well as by the server
– document.cookie = "key1=value1;key2=value2;expires=date";
– when you read the cookie , you can only see the key=value bits
– it works as a String that you can append more key=value(s) to
HTTP Cookies
