• Sessions set a user-key/ID on the user's computer
– Web storage: client-side sessions, to allow separate instances of the same
web app to run in different windows without interfering with each other
– Traditional cookies: communication with server
• When you open a page, it scans the computer for a user-key.
– If there is a match, it accesses that session
– If not, it starts a new session
• Session data is not saved in the cookie, just the session ID
• Session data is stored server-side
– You might recall $_SESSION from PHP:
• $_SESSION["favanimal"] = "cat";
– In Node/Express, you need to add an appropriate store to manage this data
• The most popular is Redis
– Officially, Redis is not supported on Windows, but you can still install it:
